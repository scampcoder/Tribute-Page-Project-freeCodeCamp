      <li>There are over 5000 species of jumping spider – this makes them the most numerous of species in the spider
        family.</li>
      <li>They can be found all over the world and thrive in various types of habitat, from mountainous regions to
        deserts. </li>

        distinguish between prey and danger. </li>
      <li>The hair on their legs helps them walk across very smooth surfaces like glass more easily.</li>
      <li>They can jump about 50 times their body length!</li>
